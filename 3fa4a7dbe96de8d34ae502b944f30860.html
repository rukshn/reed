They have to go out and justify shit that even their leaders don't believe. They're just intellectual cannon fodder. (1/11) #CoupLK</p><p>Mahinda never wanted an election. The idea was to bribe some MPs, visit the Chinese Ambassador and walk into a paid-for Parliament. It worked before. (2/11)</p><p>It just didn't work now. The UNP somehow resisted and the bribery became a farce and an outrage. They simply could not get the numbers. It was at this point that the coup actually failed. Everything that follows is just them failing to realize it. (3/11)</p><p>Given time, the courts ground into gear, Parliament started meeting and they were well and truly fucked. A coup has to be fast, otherwise institutions are too powerful. This was taking a month. (4/11)</p><p>People were metaphorically beating them with the Constitution and when they tried throwing the literal Constitution at the Speaker's head that just made things worse. They were confused. (5/11)</p><p>Then they thought, 'A-ha, elections!' Sounds democratic even if you're currently unelected and squatting on government property. Gota was like 'fuck you guys, I had all my logos and shit made for 2020', but they really had no choice. (6/11)</p><p>So that's where they are. And that's where the #LetMeVote crew comes in. Their leaders have a brain-fart and the shit comes out on their end. Of course they can't win, because their leaders have already lost. (7/11)</p><p>These guys are reduced to taking photos next to other protests to make themselves look bigger. They're roping in random white people to hold signs. They are caught in constant lies, stupidities, and logical inconsistencies. They are laughed at. (8/11)</p><p>It must be a bit hard, because at their core they want something simple - for their side to win. They must honestly think their side is worth betraying conscience, country and integrity for. They surely don't even see it that way. (9/11)</p><p>But it is that way, so I don't feel that bad. The issue is still not nearly settled and it can go many terrible ways where they would be laughing at us over the ashes of our democracy. (10/11)</p><p>Mahinda and Maithripala have provided morally, ethically and logically bankrupt leadership and some people have followed them. Thankfully, more people have not. Our parents lived through worse as tragedy. At least for now, we are experience it as farce.
